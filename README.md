# Youtube Music

A simple Nim program that will scrape the names of song titles in an album from an HTML file and rename a folder of songs. Useful for when the downloaded file names are in a different language than what is displayed online. Note that this assumes that the songs are sorted in the same order as they appear on the site (such as by prepending the song number to the file).
